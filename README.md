# Model Predictive Control (MPC) for Car Control

This repository contains an implementation of Model Predictive Control (MPC) for controlling a car based on the bicycle model. The MPC algorithm predicts the future behavior of the car over a finite time horizon and generates control inputs to optimize a specified objective function while satisfying the constraints.
